                    <p style="color: white">B-School, a Training Academy, is a project idealized and promoted by
                        experienced people and a large group of interested parties, which materialized in December 2003
                        as a Training
                        Association for Industry. It was born from the merger of the training structures, assuming its
                        own autonomous
                        role whoÂ knew how to combine all the know-how of these entities. </p>
                    <p style="color: white">B-School has been certified by DGERT as a Training Entity since June 2004
                        and
                        its Quality Management System is certified according to ISO 9001: 2008. In addition, in 2006, it
                        was recognized by His Excellency The Prime Minister as an Institution of Public Utility,
                        according to Order No. 11 707/2006. </p>
